"Question Answer" is a Worpress Plugin to guide Visitors through questions and lead them to a Final page based on the answers the users clicked. Let me show you how it works with an example:
You want to give a consultation about Computers, first you would ask the Visitor if he needs a mobile or a desktop PC. If he needs a Desktop PC you would ask him for his budget and then show him Computers that are Desktop PCs and fit into his Budget.
See an german example at http://www.datenrettung-ohne-backup.de/rescue-tool/ it helps the User to rescue Data and asks what operating system he is using and what he did at all that he needs to recover files. In the End it gives a Link to an Article which describes what to do in this special situation.

Question answer should be pretty well for SEO too because you get a lot of intern Links.

HowTo install and Use the "Question Answer" Plugin:
Installation is as easy as with every Wordpress plugin copy into your wp-content/plugins folder and activate it.
Now add questions and link the answers to other questions. You can use the "title" field for HTML content below the question and the "content" field will be used for HTML below the answers.
After setting up the questions it's time to define a page which shall show them. Add a page and insert <1qaplugin> where 1 is the number of the question which shall be displayed first.
